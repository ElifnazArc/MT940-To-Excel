# MT940 To Excel

The "MT940 to Excel" project involves developing a Java-based application that reads and parses MT940 bank statement
files, a standard format used for electronic bank statements. The parsed data is then structured and exported into an
Excel spreadsheet, allowing for easy analysis and reporting.
